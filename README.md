## Description

This is a simple flask website which uses "YouTube Data API v3" to fetch information of a particular channel given the URL of channel in JSON format.

Currently the website shows data like subscribers, number of videos, total videos, description of channel and information of playlists of that channel.

We'll be adding beautiful dashboards to the website so that it looks more alive and interactive.
